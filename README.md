# IdeasBucket

##### This is a website where you can share ideas and create communitie upon ideas. After watching tons of tutorials and utilizing the educators' techniques, I have managed to create this more complex site.

##### This project was written with the help of open source libraries, listed in the "requirements.txt" file, and open source code.
